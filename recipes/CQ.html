        <p>This cheeseburger quesadilla was inspired by one of my favorite burritos from <strong>Burrito-Ville</strong>, a local joint down by Southeast Missouri State University. Burrito-Ville specializes in some of the <em>oddest</em> burritos I've ever tasted. From the BBQ chicken burrito to the Buffalo burrito, I've had them all — but they've got only one type of quesadilla. So I decided to take one of my favorite burritos from there, the cheeseburger burrito, and apply it to quesadilla form. Served with a side of fries and a Coke, I call this my most recent culinary <strong>triumph</strong>. Serve with extra ketchup, mustard, and relish.</p>


        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>1 teaspoon butter</li>
            <li>½ small yellow onion, chopped</li>
            <li>2 pounds ground beef</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>cooking spray</li>
            <li>8 (8 inch) flour tortillas</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded Colby cheese</li>
            <li>4 teaspoons ketchup, or to taste</li>
            <li>4 teaspoons yellow mustard, or to taste</li>
            <li>4 teaspoons sweet relish, or to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir onion in melted butter until slightly tender, about <strong>5</strong> minutes. Add ground beef, Worcestershire sauce, salt, pepper, and garlic powder; cook and stir until beef is browned and crumbly, about <strong>10</strong> minutes. Remove from the heat, drain liquid from beef, and let sit for 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, heat a griddle or flat pan over medium heat and spray with cooking spray.</li>
            <li>Place 1 tortilla on the hot griddle, top with some of the Colby cheese, 1/4 of the beef mixture, 1 teaspoon ketchup, 1 teaspoon mustard, and 1 teaspoon relish. Top with more Colby cheese and 1 tortilla. Flatten the quesadilla with your hand.</li>
            <li>Flip quesadilla with a spatula and cook until browned and cheese is melted, 3 to 5 minutes more. Cut quesadilla into 4 pieces. Repeat with remaining tortillas, ground beef, cheese, ketchup, mustard, and relish.</li>
        </ol>
